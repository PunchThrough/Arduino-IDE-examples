/* 
  This sketch shows you how to monitor if your Bean moves by sampling the acceleration at 5Hz and measuring change. 
  
  The LED will blink red when it's being moved.
  
  Please note that if motion detection is triggered often, the LED use will drain the battery quickly.
    
  This example code is in the public domain.
